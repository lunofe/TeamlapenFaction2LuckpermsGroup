# TeamLapen faction âž” LuckPerms group

This is a Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge server-side mod, designed for the official Vampirism & Werewolves server _[Vampirism.co](https://vampirsm.co)_. The mod reads each player's TeamLapen faction, level, lord rank, and vampiric ageing age, then assigns them a corresponding LuckPerms group based on their faction and adds a suffix indicating their level. Note that the settings are hardcoded and the mod may require code adjustments to function outside its intended environment. Support for this mod is minimal.
